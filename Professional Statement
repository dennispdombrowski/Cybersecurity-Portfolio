I am highly motivated and always ready to learn about the newest developments in the field.  I am enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.

I highly value protecting the assets of the organization and its people along with adhering to the CIA triad to ensure that policies and proceedures are in place to adhere to compliance, standards, and the law.
